Description: Set go minimum version to 1.22
 Starting in go 1.21, the "go $VERSION" line in the go.mod file is no longer an
 advisory on which toolchain version should be used. Instead, it mandates that
 a version greater or equal the specified one is used. When the local go
 version does not meet that requirement, the go tooling tries to download a new
 version of the toolchain to meet that requirement.
 There is no documentation in the docker composer upstream development history
 for the version bump from 1.22.0 to 1.22.10. Let's loosen this requirement. The
 changes in between those versions can be seen in
 https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.22.minor.
 See https://go.dev/doc/toolchain for further reference.
